Draw a UML diagram of your Personal Assistant course application. To work, you can use the free draw.io or any other application convenient for you.
Your course app is now running in console mode and interacting with the user through commands in the console. The application needs to be developed and the most frequently modified part of the application is usually the user interface (console so far). Modify your application code so that the presentation of information to the user (displaying cards with the user's contacts, notes, a page with information about available commands) is easy to change. To do this, we need to describe an abstract base class for custom views and concrete implementations that inherit the base class and implement the console interface. In the future, we will expand the application by adding a Web interface there.
